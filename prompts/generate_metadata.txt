I'm taking articles from a wiki that I use for my D&D campaign and converting them into structured data I can use progromatically. This wiki uses the markdown `.md` file format with one change, which is that you can link articles with [[Double Brackets]], like in wikitext. You can change the displayed text with a pipe, like this: [[Elves|Elf]], which will display "Elves", but link to the article titled "Elf".

The structured data we want to fill out for the article about {topic} is:

{structured_data}

Please fill out the structured data in a way consistent with the text of the article and the snippets from linked articles below:

{snippets}

{article}

Please return only the structured data, without commentary. Again, the subject of the article is "{topic}".
