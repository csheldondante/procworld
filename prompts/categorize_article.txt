I'm taking articles from a wiki that I use for my D&D campaign and converting them into structured data I can use progromatically. This wiki uses the markdown `.md` file format with one change, which is that you can link articles with [[Double Brackets]], like in wikitext. You can change the displayed text with a pipe, like this: [[Elves|Elf]], which will display "Elves", but link to the article titled "Elf".

Depending on the subject of the article there is different structured information we want to extract.  The different categories of article we care about are: {categories}.

Please choose all the categories that apply to the subject of the article {topic} and list them as a comma separated list.  The article is:

{article}

Please return only the list, without commentary.
