The origins of the conflict that led to the treaty are rooted in the [Ancient War](Ancient%20War.md), where territorial disputes and the struggle for resources between the settled kingdoms and the wandering tribes of the [Nomads of the Eastern Sands](Nomads%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Sands.md) reached a violent crescendo. The war raged for decades, leaving scars upon the land and its people that would take generations to heal.

The negotiations for peace were spearheaded by the esteemed diplomat [Alyndra](Alyndra.md), whose wisdom and tact were instrumental in bringing the two factions to the negotiating table. The talks were held in neutral territory, within the serene surroundings of [Crystal Lake](Crystal%20Lake.md), a site chosen for its symbolic significance as a place of purity and reflection.

## Provisions

The treaty outlined several key provisions aimed at fostering a lasting peace:

1. Recognition of sovereignty: Both parties acknowledged each other's right to exist and govern without external interference.
2. Trade and travel: The establishment of the [Sea Merchant's Path](Sea%20Merchant'S%20Path.md) and the [Silk Road](Silk%20Road.md) as free trade routes, accessible to both Aesheronians and nomads.
3. Resource sharing: Agreements on the shared use of vital resources, such as water from [Crystal Lake](Crystal%20Lake.md) and access to the [Dwarven Mines](Dwarven%20Mines.md).
4. Cultural exchange: The promotion of cultural understanding through festivals like the [Moonflower Festival](Moonflower%20Festival.md) and scholarly exchanges at the [Great Library of Eldara](Great%20Library%20of%20Eldara.md).
