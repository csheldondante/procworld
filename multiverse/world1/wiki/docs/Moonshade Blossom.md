# Moonshade Blossom

The Moonshade Blossom is a rare and mystical flower found in the heart of the [Whispering Woods](Whispering%20Woods.md), a place where the veil between the mundane and the magical is as thin as the gossamer wings of a [Will-O'-The-Wisp](Will-O'-The-Wisp.md). This elusive flora is not only a marvel to behold but also a potent component in the arts of [Healing](Healing.md) and [Enchantment](Enchantment.md).

## Description

The Moonshade Blossom is distinguished by its luminescent petals that emit a soft, ethereal glow under the light of the [Moon](Moon.md). The petals range in color from a deep violet to a shimmering silver, reflecting the moon's phases. The flower's core is said to hold a drop of pure moonlight, encapsulated within a crystal-like bulb, which is the source of its healing properties.

## Habitat and Growth

Thriving in the shadowy undergrowth of the [Ironbark Trees](Ironbark%20Trees.md), the Moonshade Blossom requires the unique conditions provided by the Whispering Woods. It is believed that the flower draws its power from the whispered secrets of the woods, growing in places where the moon's reflection is strongest. The blossoms are a rare sight, blooming only during the nights of the full moon, making their collection a task for only the most dedicated of [Herbalists](Herbalists.md) or [Alchemists](Alchemists.md).

## Healing Properties

The most skilled practitioners can even enchant the petals to create elixirs that heal grievous injuries, as mentioned in the lore surrounding the [Orbs of Destiny](Orbs%20of%20Destiny.md) and the [Throne of the Mountain King](Throne%20of%20the%20Mountain%20King.md).
