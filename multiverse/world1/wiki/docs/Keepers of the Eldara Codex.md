# Keepers of the Eldara Codex

The [Keepers of the Eldara Codex](Keepers%20of%20the%20Eldara%20Codex.md) are a venerable order of scholars, archivists, and [wizards](Wizard.md) dedicated to the preservation and protection of ancient knowledge within the [Kingdom of Alyndra](Kingdom%20of%20Alyndra.md). Their origins are shrouded in the mists of time, but their influence and authority in matters of arcane lore and historical texts are recognized throughout the lands of Aesheron.

## History

"The founding of the Keepers of the Eldara Codex in the aftermath of the Mage Wars.

The Keepers were founded in the aftermath of the [Mage Wars](Mage%20Wars.md), a tumultuous period when the reckless use of magic threatened to tear the very fabric of reality asunder. In the wake of such chaos, the Keepers arose, vowing to safeguard the remnants of arcane wisdom and to prevent such a catastrophe from ever recurring. They established their headquarters within the hallowed halls of the [Great Library of Eldara](Great%20Library%20of%20Eldara.md), which has since become the heart of their operations.

## Structure and Hierarchy

The Keepers are led by a council known as the Eldara Conclave, composed of the most esteemed members of the order. This council is responsible for making decisions that shape the policies and direction of the Keepers. Beneath the Conclave, the order is divided into several ranks, each with specific duties:

- **Archivists**: Tasked with the restoration and preservation of ancient texts and artifacts.
- **Lorekeepers**: Scholars who study the vast collections and interpret their meanings.
- **Sentinels**: A specialized group trained in both combat and magic, responsible for the protection of the Keepers' domain and the enforcement of their edicts.
- **Initiates**: New members who are undergoing rigorous training to join the ranks of the Keepers.

## Responsibilities

The Keepers' primary role is the stewardship of the [Great Library of Eldara](Great%20Library%20of%20Eldara.md), where they manage an ever-growing compendium of knowledge. Their responsibilities include:

- **Acquisition**: Seeking out new texts, artifacts, and magical tomes to add to the library's collections.
- **Preservation**: Employing advanced magical and mundane techniques to maintain the integrity of ancient documents.
- **Research**: Conducting studies on a wide array of subjects, from the [Ancients](Ancients.md) to the [Lunar Ancients](Lunar%20Ancients.md), and from [sorcery](Sorcery.md) to the natural world.
- **Education**: Sharing knowledge with the scholars of Aesheron and providing guidance to those who seek to learn the arcane arts.

## Influence and Relations

The Keepers maintain a complex web of relationships with various organizations and powers, including the [Councils of the Free Cities](Councils%20of%20the%20Free%20Cities.md), the [Order of the Veiled Eye](Order%20of%20the%20Veiled%20Eye.md), and the [Mages of the Crystal Tower](Mages%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Tower.md). They are often consulted on matters of historical significance and arcane threats, such as the resurgence of the [Dark Horde](Dark%20Horde.md) or the mysterious appearances of [Shade Wraiths](Shade%20Wraiths.md).

Their influence extends to diplomatic affairs, as seen in their involvement in the drafting of the [Treaty of the Crystal Waters](Treaty%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Waters.md), which helped to establish peace among the warring factions of the [Monarchies of the Northern Realms](Monarchies%20of%20the%20Northern%20Realms.md).

## Mysteries and Secrets

While the Keepers are known for their dissemination of knowledge, they also harbor secrets that are kept from the public eye. It is rumored that within the deepest vaults of the library lie forbidden texts and relics from the [Ancient War](Ancient%20War.md), guarded by the most trusted Sentinels. These items are deemed too dangerous or powerful for the world at large, and the Keepers believe that their concealment is a necessary measure to prevent another cataclysm.

## Notable Members

Throughout history, several Keepers have risen to prominence, such as [Morath the Wise](Morath%20the%20Wise.md), who is renowned for his contributions to the study of [moonflower](Moonflower.md) alchemy, and [Tharion](Tharion.md), the master archivist who discovered the lost spells of the [Verdant Woods](Verdant%20Woods.md).

## Legacy

The Keepers of the Eldara Codex continue to be a beacon of enlightenment in a world where darkness often threatens to engulf the light of knowledge. Their dedication to the preservation of the past ensures that the future generations of Aesheron will inherit a legacy rich with wisdom and understanding.
