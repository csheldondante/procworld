# Wraiths

Wraiths are ethereal entities that inhabit the twilight realm of the [Shadowfell](Shadowfell.md), a plane of existence where the barrier between the living and the dead is perilously thin. These spectral beings are often the remnants of souls that were either too malevolent to pass on or too restless to settle into the afterlife. Wraiths are feared across the lands for their insatiable hunger for life and their ability to drain the very essence of the living.

## Origins

The origins of wraiths are shrouded in mystery and sorrow. Some believe that wraiths are the result of a violent death or unresolved vengeance, while others speculate that they are the creations of dark [Magic](Magic.md) gone awry. In the [Ancient War](Ancient%20War.md), it is said that many fallen warriors became wraiths, cursed to relive their final moments for eternity.

## Characteristics

Wraiths are incorporeal, their forms often appearing as dark, wispy figures with hauntingly hollow eyes. They are bound to the [Shadowfell](Shadowfell.md) but can occasionally find passage to the material plane through tears in the fabric of reality or by the summoning of a powerful [Summoner](Summoner.md) or [Warlock](Warlock.md). Wraiths possess a chilling aura that can freeze the heart of the bravest [Warriors](Warriors.md), and their touch can sap the strength from even the most formidable foes.

### Abilities

- **Life Drain:** Wraiths can absorb the life force of living creatures, leaving behind nothing but withered husks.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** They can pass through solid objects and walls, making them nearly impossible to contain.
- **Shadow Blend:** In low light or darkness, wraiths can become nearly invisible, blending seamlessly with the shadows.

## Behavior

Wraiths are solitary by nature, driven by their own insatiable desires and the torment of their existence. They are known to be cunning and relentless, often stalking their prey for long periods before striking. Despite their solitary tendencies, wraiths have been known to ally with other denizens of the [Shadowfell](Shadowfell.md), such as the [Shadar-Kai](Shadar-Kai.md) and [Shadow Dragons](Shadow%20Dragons.md), when it serves their purposes.

## Interaction with the Living

Wraiths are generally hostile to the living, as their presence is a constant reminder of the life they can no longer possess. However, there are rare instances where a wraith might communicate with a living being, usually through a [Spirit](Spirit.md) medium or a [cleric](Clerics.md) skilled in the arts of the dead. Such interactions are fraught with danger, as wraiths are deceitful and may seek to manipulate the living to achieve their own ends.

## Magical Associations

In the realm of magical study, wraiths are a subject of both fear and fascination. [Reagents](Reagents.md) that contain the essence of a wraith are highly sought after for their potent magical properties. These reagents can be used to enhance spells, particularly those involving the [Undead](Undead.md) or the manipulation of life force.

## Known Wraiths

While most wraiths are nameless horrors, a few have gained notoriety through their actions or the legends surrounding them. One such wraith is the infamous [Seraphine the Seer](Seraphine%20the%20Seer.md), who was transformed into a wraith after attempting to unveil the secrets of [Creation](Creation.md) itself.

## Defense Against Wraiths

To protect oneself against a wraith, one must be well-versed in the arts of [Binding](Binding.md) and protective [Magic](Magic.md). Certain [Herbs](Herbs.md) and [Whispering Sirens Artifacts](Whispering%20Sirens%20Artifacts.md) are believed to ward off these malevolent spirits. [Paladins](Paladins.md) and [Healers](Healers.md) are also known for their ability to repel and sometimes redeem wraiths, guiding them towards peace and the afterlife.

## Conclusion

Wraiths remain one of the most feared and mysterious entities in the world. Their existence is a testament to the complex nature of life, death, and the realms beyond. Those who seek to understand wraiths must tread carefully, for the path is perilous and the consequences of faltering are dire.
