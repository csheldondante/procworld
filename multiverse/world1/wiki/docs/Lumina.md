# Lumina

Lumina, often revered as the Maiden of Light, is a celestial entity embodying the quintessence of radiance and purity within the pantheon of sun deities. As the patron of healers, artists, and all those who seek clarity and inspiration, Lumina's influence extends far beyond the confines of her ethereal domain, touching the lives of mortals across the many realms.

## Origins and Worship

The earliest records of Lumina's worship trace back to the [Elven](Elven.md) sages of the eponymous city of [Lumina](Lumina.md), a place renowned for its breathtaking architecture that harmonizes with the natural world. These sages, attuned to the cycles of the sun and stars, recognized Lumina's presence in the extended daylight of the [Solstice of the Blazing Sky](Solstice%20of%20the%20Blazing%20Sky.md), a time when the boundaries between the [Ethereal Plane](Ethereal%20Plane.md) and the material world are believed to wane, allowing for heightened spiritual communion.

Temples dedicated to Lumina are often adorned with gold and crystal, designed to catch and amplify the sun's rays, creating a cascade of light that symbolizes her eternal glow. Within these hallowed halls, [Priests](Priests.md) and acolytes conduct ceremonies that celebrate the virtues of light, offering solace and guidance to those who seek Lumina's blessings.

## The Ethereal Plains of Lumina

The ethereal plains of Lumina are said to be a realm of perpetual twilight, where the horizon is painted with the soft hues of dawn and dusk. This otherworldly expanse serves as a sanctuary for celestial creatures such as the [Silvermane Horses](Silvermane%20Horses.md), known for their shimmering coats and the trails of luminescent mist they leave in their wake. It is within these plains that Lumina's essence is most potent, and where the most devout followers hope to transcend during their spiritual journeys.
