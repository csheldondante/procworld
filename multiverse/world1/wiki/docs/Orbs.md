# Orbs

Orbs have been a subject of fascination and utility in the realms of magic and mysticism throughout the ages. These spherical objects, often crafted from crystal or glass, serve as conduits for arcane energy, tools for divination, and symbols of celestial phenomena. The crafting and use of orbs are deeply entrenched in the practices of [Arcane Practitioners](Arcane%20Practitioners.md), [Mystics](Mystics.md), and [Summoners](Summoners.md), making them integral to the fabric of magical society.

## History and Significance

The origin of orbs traces back to ancient times when the first [Mages](Mages.md) observed the perfect shape of celestial bodies and sought to emulate their form to capture their essence. The earliest orbs were rudimentary, made from polished stone or naturally occurring crystal. As the art of glassmaking advanced, so did the complexity and potency of orbs. They became not only tools but also works of art, reflecting the skill and status of their creators.

## Types of Orbs

### Orbs of Destiny

[Orbs of Destiny](Orbs%20of%20Destiny.md) are among the most sought-after magical items. These orbs are said to be infused with the power to reveal the future or hidden truths to those who gaze into their depths. Crafted by skilled [Enchanters](Enchanters.md) and often used during rituals such as the [Solstice of the Blazing Sky](Solstice%20of%20the%20Blazing%20Sky.md), these orbs are treasured by seers and [diviners](Divination.md).

### Elemental Orbs

Elemental orbs are attuned to specific [elemental energies](Elemental Energy.md), such as [Fire](Fire.md), [Water](Water.md), [Earth](Earth.md), and [Air](Air.md). They are often used to enhance spells related to their element or to commune with elemental beings. These orbs are typically found in places where the veil between the material world and the elemental planes is thin, like the [Echoing Basin](Echoing%20Basin.md).

### Scrying Orbs

Scrying orbs are used in the practice of [scrying](Divination.md), allowing users to glimpse distant places, people, or events. They are made from materials with reflective surfaces, such as polished crystal or obsidian, and are a common tool among [Mystics](Mystics.md) and [Occult Researchers](Occult%20Researchers.md).

### Summoning Orbs

In the hands of a [Summoner](Summoner.md), orbs can be pivotal in the success of a summoning ritual. These orbs may contain inscriptions, runes, or be imbued with the essence of the entity to be summoned. They help stabilize the magical circle and serve as a focus for the summoner's willpower.

## Crafting and Artisanship

The creation of an orb is a delicate process that combines the skills of [Artisans](Artisans.md) and [Enchanters](Enchanters.md). The finest orbs are often made from rare materials, such as [Moonflower](Moonflower.md) silk or the crystalline sands of the [Caverns of Echo](Caverns%20of%20Echo.md). [Jewelers](Jewelry Making.md) and artisans may set these orbs into ornate pieces, creating amulets and talismans that are both aesthetically pleasing and magically potent.

## Usage in Rituals and Ceremonies
