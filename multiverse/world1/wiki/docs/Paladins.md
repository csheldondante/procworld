# Paladins

Paladins are the embodiment of virtue and the divine will on Aesheron. These holy warriors are bound by sacred oaths to uphold justice, protect the innocent, and vanquish evil wherever it may lurk. They are revered across the lands for their unwavering commitment to their deities and their causes, serving as both guardians of the faith and champions of the people.

## Origins and Training

The origins of the first [Paladins](Paladins.md) are shrouded in legend, with tales often tracing back to the divine interventions of the [Sun Deities](Sun%20Deities.md) or other benevolent powers. These stories tell of mortals who were bestowed with celestial might to combat the rising darkness in times of great need.

Aspiring paladins typically begin their journey as squires, serving under the tutelage of a seasoned paladin or within the structured environment of a holy order, such as the renowned [Order of the Crimson Blade](Order%20of%20the%20Crimson%20Blade.md). Their training encompasses martial prowess, the study of [holy texts](Holy Texts.md), and the mastery of [divine magic](Divine Magic.md), which they channel through their unshakeable faith.

## The Paladin's Code

A paladin's power is directly tied to their adherence to a sacred code of conduct. This code varies among different orders and deities but generally includes tenets such as courage, compassion, honor, and humility. The most solemn vow a paladin makes is to stand against the forces of darkness, a commitment that often leads them to confront the [Undead](Undead.md), [Dark Horde](Dark%20Horde.md), and other malevolent entities.

## Divine Magic

Paladins are granted divine magic by their patron deities as a reward for their devotion and service. This magic manifests in various ways, from healing the wounded and curing diseases to smiting foes with holy wrath. The [Cathedral of Radiant Dawn](Cathedral%20of%20Radiant%20Dawn.md) is known for its paladins who wield the purifying light of the sun to cleanse corruption and banish shadows.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Paladins serve in many capacities within society. They may be found leading armies against encroaching threats, such as the [Dark Horde](Dark%20Horde.md), or offering counsel to the [Councils of the Free Cities](Councils%20of%20the%20Free%20Cities.md). They are also the protectors of sacred sites and enforcers of divine law, as seen with the guardianship of the [Crystal Waters](Crystal%20Waters.md) by the paladins of the Cathedral of Radiant Dawn.

In times of peace, paladins often embark on quests to recover lost [Artifacts](Artifacts.md) of religious significance or to aid communities afflicted by natural disasters or [Elemental](Elemental.md) incursions. Their presence at events like the [Solstice of the Blazing Sky](Solstice%20of%20the%20Blazing%20Sky.md) and the [Festival of Shields](Festival%20of%20Shields.md) is a testament to their integral role in the spiritual life of Aesheron.

## Relations with Other Orders

While paladins share a common goal of serving the greater good, their methods and philosophies can differ from those of other divine practitioners. The relationship between paladins and [Clerics](Clerics.md) is typically one of mutual respect and cooperation, though there can be friction when dogmatic differences arise.

Paladins may view the secretive practices of [Mystics](Mystics.md) with suspicion, and the arcane focus of [Summoners](Summoners.md) can sometimes be at odds with their own divine calling. Despite these differences, paladins are willing to form alliances with various orders when facing existential threats to the world.

## Legendary Paladins

Throughout history, there have been paladins whose deeds have become the stuff of legend. These heroes, such as [Seraphine the Seer](Seraphine%20the%20Seer.md) and the fabled [Theron of the Glade](Theron%20of%20the%20Glade.md), are celebrated in song and story, inspiring new generations of paladins to strive for greatness.

## Conclusion

Paladins are more than just warriors; they are the shining beacons of hope in a world fraught with peril. Their unwavering faith and their commitment to the highest ideals of chivalry make them indispensable to the fabric of Aesheron. Whether standing vigil at the ramparts of the [Throne of the Mountain King](Throne%20of%20the%20Mountain%20King.md) or leading a charge against the forces of darkness, paladins remain steadfast in their sacred duty to bring light to the darkest corners of the world.
