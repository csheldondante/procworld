# Solara

Solara, known reverently as the Radiant Mother, is a central figure in the pantheon of [sun deities](Sun%20Deities.md) worshiped across the vast and varied landscapes of the realm. She is the embodiment of the dawn, the gentle warmth that caresses the world awake, and the nurturing light that fosters life and growth. Her influence is felt in every ray of sunlight that pierces the morning mist and in the hopeful gaze of every creature that turns its face toward the day's first light.

## Worship and Temples

The worship of Solara is widespread and deeply ingrained in the cultures that bask under the sun's rays.

Solara's consort is [Pyronus](Pyronus.md), the Blazing Father, who represents the sun at its zenith. Together, they form a divine duality, with Solara's gentle dawn complementing Pyronus's fierce midday light. Their union is celebrated during the Solstice Festivals, where the balance of light and life is honored through feasts, music, and ceremonial dances.

The divine family of sun deities also includes lesser-known figures, each governing a different aspect of the sun's domain.
