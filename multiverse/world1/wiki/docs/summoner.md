# Summoner

A summoner is a specialized type of [arcane practitioner](arcane%20practitioner.md) whose expertise lies in the art of calling forth entities from other planes of existence, binding elemental forces, and negotiating with spirits to serve their will. Unlike their counterparts, such as [wizards](Wizards.md) and [sorcerers](sorcerers.md), summoners focus their studies and abilities on the intricate rituals and pacts necessary to entice and control these beings.

## Origins and Practice

The origins of summoning can be traced back to the ancient texts of the [Keepers of the Eldara Codex](Keepers%20of%20the%20Eldara%20Codex.md), who first documented the existence of other planes and the entities that dwell within them. Over the centuries, the practice has evolved, with summoners developing their own methodologies and ethical codes regarding the treatment of summoned beings.

Summoners often begin their journey as apprentices to a master summoner, learning the complex symbols, [reagents](reagents.md), and [arcane foci](arcane%20foci.md) necessary for summoning rituals. The most important aspect of their training is understanding the laws of [Elemental Summoning](Elemental%20Summoning.md), which govern the interactions between the summoner and the summoned.

## The Summoning Ritual

A summoning ritual typically involves the creation of a magical circle, inscribed with runes and sigils that correspond to the nature of the entity being summoned. The summoner must then use a combination of [reagents](reagents.md) and personal willpower to open a gateway to the entity's plane of origin. The success of a summoning ritual can depend on various factors, including the summoner's knowledge, the alignment of the [moon](moon.md), and the presence of certain [orbs](Orbs.md) or artifacts, such as the [Whispering Sirens](Whispering%20Sirens.md).

## Entities and Pacts

Summoners can call upon a wide array of entities, ranging from the mischievous [water sprites](water%20sprites.md) of the [Crystal Sea](Crystal%20Sea.md) to the mighty [Fire elementals](Fire%20elementals.md) that dwell within the [Verdant Woods](Verdant%20Woods.md). The nature of the entity often dictates the terms of the pact, which is a mutual agreement that outlines the services expected of the summoned being and the compensation they will receive in return.

Some summoners specialize in the summoning of [Fey](Fey.md) creatures, while others may focus on elemental beings or even celestial entities. The most powerful summoners are known to have pacted with entities from the [Well of Stars](Well%20of%20Stars.md), gaining insights into the cosmos that few others can fathom.

## Ethical Considerations

The ethical implications of summoning are a topic of heated debate among [arcane practitioners](arcane%20practitioners.md). Some argue that the binding of another being's will is an act of domination, while others believe that as long as the pact is honored and the entity is treated with respect, the practice is justified. The [Council of Elders in Silverlake Valley](Council%20of%20Elders%20in%20Silverlake%20Valley.md) has established guidelines to ensure that summoners operate within the bounds of ethical conduct.

## Summoners in Society

Summoners often find their skills in high demand, whether it be for the defense of a realm against the [Dark Horde](Dark%20Horde.md), aiding [adventurers](Adventurers.md) in their quests, or serving the [Councils of the Free Cities](Councils%20of%20the%20Free%20Cities.md) with their unique abilities. Their knowledge of other planes and the beings that inhabit them also makes them invaluable to those seeking to understand the mysteries of the universe, such as [Seraphine the Seer](Seraphine%20the%20Seer.md).

In the world of magic and mystery, summoners walk a fine line between control and cooperation, power and responsibility. Their ability to bridge the gap between worlds makes them both revered and feared, and their presence is a testament to the boundless possibilities of the arcane arts.
