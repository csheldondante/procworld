# Divination

Divination is the arcane practice through which [Wizards](Wizards.md), [sorcerers](Sorcerers.md), and other [spellcasters](Spellcasters.md) seek to gain insight into past mysteries, present occurrences, and future events. This mystical art is one of the most revered and enigmatic branches of [spellcraft](Spellcraft.md), often requiring years of study and a deep connection to the unseen forces of the world.

## Overview

At its core, Divination involves the interpretation of omens, the casting of spells, and the use of various [arcane foci](Arcane%20Foci.md) to perceive the threads of fate and the whispers of time. Practitioners of Divination, known as Diviners, are highly sought after for their abilities to provide guidance, reveal secrets, and predict outcomes with remarkable accuracy.

## Methods of Divination

Divination can be performed through a multitude of methods, each with its own traditions and tools. Some of the most common techniques include:

- **Augury**: Interpreting the will of the divine by reading signs and portents, often through the flight patterns of birds or the entrails of sacrificed creatures.
- **Astrology**: Charting the positions of stars and planets to understand their influence on the mortal realm and individual destinies.
