# Wizardry

Wizardry is the art and science of manipulating the very fabric of reality through the use of [magic](Magic.md). It is a practice steeped in ancient traditions, rigorous study, and the pursuit of arcane knowledge. Wizards, the primary practitioners of this craft, are often seen as scholars and researchers, dedicating their lives to understanding the underlying principles that govern the magical forces of the world.

## History of Wizardry

The origins of wizardry are as old as the first civilizations that dotted the landscapes of the known world. The earliest records of wizardly practices are found in the ruins of the [Lost Temple of the Moon](Lost%20Temple%20of%20the%20Moon.md), where hieroglyphs depict figures wielding magical energies. Over the centuries, wizardry has evolved, influenced by the teachings of legendary figures such as [Morath](Morath.md), whose philosophies laid the foundation for the modern understanding of the arcane.

## Schools of Wizardry

Wizardry is divided into various schools of thought, each focusing on a different aspect of magical theory and application. These schools include, but are not limited to:

- [Abjuration](Abjuration.md): The magic of protection and warding.
- [Conjuration](Conjuration.md): The art of summoning creatures and objects from across planes.
- [Divination](Divination.md): The practice of foresight and gathering information through magical means.
- [Enchantment](Enchantment.md): The craft of influencing minds and imbuing objects with magical properties.
- [Evocation](Evocation.md): The manipulation of elemental energies to create powerful effects.
- [Illusion](Illusion.md): The creation of sensory deceptions to beguile and confuse.
- [Necromancy](Necromancy.md): The controversial study of life force and the animation of the dead.
- [Transmutation](Transmutation.md): The alteration of matter and energy's fundamental properties.

Each school is a deep well of knowledge, with its own techniques, [incantations](Incantations.md), and [rituals](Rituals.md).

## The Practice of Wizardry

To become a wizard is to embark on a lifelong journey of discovery. Aspiring wizards often begin their training under the tutelage of a master, at institutions such as the [Sanctum of Whispers](Sanctum%20of%20Whispers.md) or within the hallowed halls of the [Crystal Tower](Crystal%20Tower.md). The path to mastery involves the learning of [arcane languages](Arcane Languages.md), the study of ancient texts, and the practical application of magical theory.

Wizards are known to carry [arcane foci](Arcane Foci.md) to channel their magical energies more effectively. These foci can range from simple wands and staves to elaborate orbs and crystals, each attuned to the wizard's personal style and the type of magic they wield.

## Wizardry in Society

Wizards hold a unique place in society, often serving as advisors to [monarchs](Monarchies of the Northern Realms.md), members of the [Council of Arcana](Council%20of%20Arcana.md), or independent researchers. Their ability to control the elements, divine the future, and even alter the fabric of reality makes them invaluable assets and sometimes feared individuals.

In the [Principality of Morath](Principality%20of%20Morath.md), wizardry is not only respected but is the cornerstone of its culture. Here, wizards of all disciplines come together to advance the collective knowledge of the arcane and apply it for the betterment of society.

## Wizardry and Warfare

In times of conflict, wizards can be formidable opponents. Their command over spells such as [Control Weather](Control%20Weather.md) and [Ice Storm](Ice%20Storm.md) can turn the tide of battle. The strategic use of wizardry has been documented in the annals of [Military Strategy](Military%20Strategy.md), showcasing how the arcane can be a decisive factor in warfare.

## The Future of Wizardry

The pursuit of wizardry is an ever-evolving field, with new discoveries and innovations constantly expanding the boundaries of what is possible. The [Oracle of Morath](Oracle%20of%20Morath.md) has prophesied a new era of wizardry, one where the arcane will blend with other forms of magic and even technology, leading to advancements beyond current comprehension.

The world of wizardry is vast and filled with mysteries waiting to be unraveled. It beckons those with the intellect and the courage to delve into its depths and emerge with the secrets that lie within.
