# Abjurers

Abjurers are the stalwart guardians of the arcane, dedicated to the mastery of protective magic and the safeguarding of the realms of Aesheron. These practitioners of [abjuration](abjuration.md) magic are a beacon of hope in a world fraught with danger, standing as bulwarks against the forces that seek to harm or corrupt.

## Role and Abilities

Abjurers serve a vital role in the defense of cities, sanctuaries, and individuals. Their abilities allow them to create powerful wards, magical barriers, and enchantments that protect against both physical and magical harm. In the chaos of conflict, an abjurer's skills are invaluable, as they can conjure shields to safeguard their allies, including [mages](mages.md), [priests](priests.md), and [warriors](warriors.md).

The most renowned abjurers can even banish malevolent entities, such as the elusive [Whispering Sirens](Whispering%20Sirens.md), back to their own realms, or contain them long enough for other measures to be taken. This capability is not only a testament to their power but also to their deep understanding of the magical laws that govern reality.

## Training and Education

Aspiring abjurers must commit to a rigorous path of study and discipline. Many seek knowledge at prestigious institutions like the [Great Library of Eldara](Great%20Library%20of%20Eldara.md), where the ancient tomes of protective magic offer a wealth of knowledge. Others may apprentice under a master abjurer, learning the intricacies of abjuration through direct mentorship and practice.

The training of an abjurer is multifaceted, requiring a firm grasp of [incantations](incantations.md), [reagents](reagents.md), and the manipulation of magical energies. It is said that the most successful abjurers possess not only intellectual prowess but also an indomitable spirit, as the art of abjuration demands both mental and emotional resilience.

## Tools and Artifacts

Abjurers often employ various [arcane foci](arcane%20foci.md) to enhance their magical capabilities. Crystals, in particular, are highly valued for their affinity with protective magic. The [Mistbound Docks](Mistbound%20Docks.md) are a hub for the trade of such crystals, where abjurers from across the land gather to procure these potent artifacts.

In addition to crystals, abjurers may utilize specially crafted wands, staves, and amulets that have been imbued with abjuration magic. These items can amplify their protective spells, making their barriers more resilient and their wards more potent.

## Societal Impact

The presence of abjurers within a community is a sign of security and stability. They are often members of the [Council of Defense](Council%20of%20Defense.md) or serve in advisory roles to rulers and leaders, such as those within the [Councils of the Free Cities](Councils%20of%20the%20Free%20Cities.md). Their expertise is not only sought in times of war but also in the construction of defenses for important structures, like the [Crystal Tower](Crystal%20Tower.md) or [Stormhold Castle](Stormhold%20Castle.md).

During times of peace, abjurers contribute to society by enchanting public spaces with wards to prevent accidents and by teaching the principles of self-defense to citizens. Their knowledge of protective magic is also a key component in the maintenance of peace treaties, such as the [Treaty of the Crystal Waters](Treaty%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Waters.md) and the [Treaty of the Silverlake](Treaty%20of%20the%20Silverlake.md), ensuring that magical safeguards are in place to uphold the agreements.

## Notable Abjurers

Throughout history, there have been many abjurers whose deeds have become the stuff of legend. These individuals are often celebrated in tales that are passed down through generations, inspiring future abjurers to strive for greatness. Some notable abjurers have been enshrined in the annals of history for their pivotal roles in events like the [Battle of Broken Spears](Battle%20of%20Broken%20Spears.md) and the defense of the [Queendom of Aesheron](Queendom%20of%20Aesheron.md) during the incursion of the [Dark Horde](Dark%20Horde.md).

## Conclusion

Abjurers are more than mere spellcasters; they are the protectors of the fabric of society, the unseen shield against the darkness. Their dedication to the art of protection ensures that the people of Aesheron can sleep a little sounder at night, knowing that there are those who have devoted their lives to warding off the shadows that lurk just beyond the light.
