# Abjuration

Abjuration is the school of magic that specializes in the creation of protective barriers, the banishment of malevolent entities, and the nullification of harmful spells. Practitioners of Abjuration, known as [abjurers](abjurers.md), are revered across Aesheron for their ability to shield individuals, locations, and even entire cities from the myriad dangers that plague the world. The art of Abjuration is a cornerstone of magical defense and is integral to the stability and safety of the realms.

## Origins and Principles

The origins of Abjuration magic are as ancient as the [moon deities](moon%20deities.md) themselves, with the earliest records found within the [Great Library of Eldara](Great%20Library%20of%20Eldara.md). These texts speak of a time when the world was young, and the need for protection against the primordial forces was paramount. Abjuration was developed as a means to guard against these threats, and over the centuries, it has evolved into a sophisticated and highly respected school of magic.

The principles of Abjuration are rooted in the manipulation of magical energies to create barriers that can repel or contain. These barriers can be physical, such as a wall of force, or more esoteric, such as wards against scrying or mental intrusion. Abjuration magic can also be used to dispel or counteract other magical effects, making it invaluable in battles against [sorcerers](sorcerers.md) and [enchanters](enchanters.md).

## Applications of Abjuration

### Protective Wards

One of the most common uses of Abjuration is the creation of wards. These magical protections are employed by the [councils](councils.md) of the [Shrouded City](Shrouded%20City.md) to safeguard the [Mistbound Docks](Mistbound%20Docks.md) from external threats. Wards can be placed on objects, such as the enchanted hulls of ships, or around entire districts, creating a safe haven for the citizens within.

### Banishment

Abjuration magic is also used to banish creatures, particularly those from other planes of existence. This practice is essential when dealing with extraplanar threats like [Shade Wraiths](Shade%20Wraiths.md) or [Whispering Sirens](Whispering%20Sirens.md) that may slip through the fabric of reality into Aesheron.

### Spellbreaking

Abjurers are often called upon to break curses or dispel ongoing magical effects. This aspect of Abjuration is particularly valued in the aftermath of conflicts such as the [Battle of Broken Spears](Battle%20of%20Broken%20Spears.md), where lingering enchantments may pose a danger to the uninitiated.

### Magical Shields

In the heat of battle, abjurers can conjure magical shields to protect themselves and their allies. These shields can deflect physical attacks as well as magical ones, making them indispensable to the [mages](mages.md) and [priests](priests.md) who often find themselves targeted by their foes.

## The Abjurers of Aesheron

Abjurers come from all walks of life, but they are most commonly associated with the [Mages of the Crystal Tower](Mages%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Tower.md) and the [priests](priests.md) who serve the [moon deities](moon%20deities.md). These individuals dedicate their lives to the study and mastery of protective magic, often serving as guardians for important figures or locations, such as [Stormhold Castle](Stormhold%20Castle.md) or the [Fields of Golden Grain](Fields%20of%20Golden%20Grain.md).

## Training and Study

Aspiring abjurers must undergo rigorous training, often at esteemed institutions like the [Great Library of Eldara](Great%20Library%20of%20Eldara.md) or under the tutelage of a master abjurer. The study of Abjuration requires a deep understanding of magical theory, as well as a strong will to harness and shape the protective energies.

## Artifacts and Reagents

Certain artifacts and [reagents](reagents.md) are known to enhance the power of Abjuration spells. Items such as the [moonflower](moonflower.md) petals or the rare [Silvermane Horses](Silvermane%20Horses.md)' manes are highly sought after for their amplifying properties. These materials can be used in [rituals](rituals.md) to strengthen wards or to create more potent barriers.

## Conclusion

Abjuration remains a vital aspect of magical practice in Aesheron. Its protective capabilities ensure that society can thrive even in the face of darkness and danger. Whether employed by the solitary [wizard](wizard.md) or the organized [councils](councils.md), Abjuration is the shield that guards the realms of Aesheron, a testament to the enduring power of protection and defense in the world of magic.
