## Overview

Nestled within the heart of the [Silverlake Valley](Silverlake%20Valley.md), embraced by the gentle arms of the surrounding hills, lies [The Shrouded City](The%20Shrouded%20City.md), a place of enigma and scholarly pursuit.

The Shrouded City is not merely a location but a living testament to the arcane, where the air itself hums with [magic](Magic.md) and the pursuit of the mystical arts is the lifeblood of its citizens.

## History

The origins of The Shrouded City are as mysterious as the fog that envelops it. Legend speaks of its founding by the [Lunar Ancients](Lunar%20Ancients.md), a civilization whose understanding of the celestial bodies and their arcane influences was unparalleled. After the [Ancient War](Ancient%20War.md), the city became a sanctuary for those seeking to preserve the ancient knowledge that was at risk of being lost forever.

It has been a place of refuge for the learned and the exiled, a tradition that continues to this day.

## Geography

The city's unique location contributes to its perpetual state of mist. The surrounding hills trap the moisture from the [Crystal Sea](Crystal%20Sea.md), creating a microclimate that ensures the city remains shrouded throughout the year.
