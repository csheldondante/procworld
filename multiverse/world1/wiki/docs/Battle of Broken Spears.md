## Prelude to the Battle

The [Dark Horde](Dark%20Horde.md), an alliance of malevolent entities and corrupted beings, began its relentless march towards the northern territories, driven by a hunger for conquest and dominion. The Horde's advance was marked by a trail of destruction, leaving the lands they crossed desolate and broken.

## The Forces Converge

The chosen battleground was a strategic location known as the [Plains of Valor](Plains%20of%20Valor.md), a vast expanse of open land that offered little in the way of natural defenses. The [Council of Defense](Council%20of%20Defense.md), aware of the Horde's numerical superiority, devised a plan to neutralize the enemy's advantage. General [Tharion](Tharion.md) of the [Free Cities](Free%20Cities.md) and other notable tacticians, including the esteemed Lady [Seraphine](Seraphine.md), contributed their expertise to formulating a strategy that would later be studied by military scholars for generations.

The battle commenced with a ferocious charge by the Horde, their ranks filled with fearsome creatures and dark sorcerers. However, the northern forces, disciplined and unwavering, absorbed the initial impact with a series of well-prepared defensive formations.
