# Nobility

Nobility in the world of Aesheron is a social class that is often hereditary, conferring upon its members certain privileges, responsibilities, and cultural significance. The nobles of Aesheron are typically associated with the ownership of land, the wielding of power, and the patronage of the arts and sciences. They play a crucial role in the governance and social hierarchy of the realm, often serving as rulers, advisors, or influential figures in various aspects of society.

## Origins and Hierarchy

The origins of nobility in Aesheron can be traced back to the ancient times when the first [Monarchs](Monarchs.md) and chieftains granted lands and titles to their most trusted followers. Over time, these titles became hereditary, creating a distinct upper class that was separate from the common folk. The hierarchy within the nobility is complex, with titles such as Duke, Count, Baron, and Knight, each carrying its own rank and prestige.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Nobles are expected to manage their lands and holdings, ensuring the well-being of those who live within their domains. They are responsible for collecting taxes, administering justice, and maintaining a standing force of [Soldiers](Soldiers.md) to defend their territories. In times of war, nobles may be called upon to provide troops and resources to the [kingdom's](Kingdom.md) cause.

### Governance

Many nobles hold positions of power within the political structures of Aesheron. They may serve on the [Councils of the Free Cities](Councils%20of%20the%20Free%20Cities.md) or advise the [Monarchies of the Northern Realms](Monarchies%20of%20the%20Northern%20Realms.md). In the [City of Evernight](City%20of%20Evernight.md), the [Nobility](Nobility.md) convenes in the [Palace of Twilight](Palace%20of%20Twilight.md) to deliberate on matters of state and the arcane.

### Patronage

Nobles are known for their patronage of the arts and sciences. They commission works from [artisans](Artisanal.md) and support the endeavors of [Mages](Mages.md) and [Scholars](Scholars.md). The creation of [Arcane Foci](Arcane%20Foci.md) and the enchantment of jewelry are often funded by noble houses, as are expeditions for [Treasure Hunting](Treasure%20Hunting.md) and the study of [Alchemy](Alchemy.md) and [Medicine](Medicine.md).

## Culture and Lifestyle

The lifestyle of the nobility is marked by luxury and opulence. They dwell in grand estates and castles, adorned with fine tapestries and art. Lavish feasts and balls are common, with nobles often wearing garments of [Moonflower](Moonflower.md) silk or jewelry set with magical [Orbs](Orbs.md) as symbols of their status.

### Education and Etiquette

Noble children are educated from a young age in the arts of diplomacy, strategy, and etiquette. They learn to read and write, study [Holy Texts](Holy%20Texts.md), and are often trained in the use of arms or the basics of [Conjuration](Conjuration.md) or [Evocation](Evocation.md). The cultivation of these skills ensures that they can fulfill their duties to their family and the realm.

### Religion and Spirituality

The nobility may also serve as protectors of religious and spiritual traditions. They build temples and shrines dedicated to deities such as [Solara](Solara.md) and may participate in ceremonies that honor the land, such as those overseen by the [Council of Elders in Silverlake Valley](Council%20of%20Elders%20in%20Silverlake%20Valley.md).
