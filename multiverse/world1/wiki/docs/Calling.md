# Calling

Calling is a mystical practice within the school of [Conjuration](Conjuration.md), a branch of [Spellcraft](Spellcraft.md) that deals with the manifestation of entities and objects from one plane of existence to another. It is an ancient and complex art, revered and feared for its potential to alter the tides of both battles and the more subtle realms of knowledge and construction.

## Overview

At its core, Calling involves the summoner reaching across the boundaries of reality to bring forth creatures, spirits, or even raw energies to the material plane. Unlike its close relative, [Summoning](Summoning.md), which often results in temporary manifestations, Calling typically implies a more substantial and sometimes permanent presence of the summoned entity. The creatures or entities called forth are usually sentient and possess their own will, though they are bound to the summoner's commands through intricate magical pacts.

## Applications of Calling

### Military Use

Historically, Calling has been employed in warfare, with conjurers summoning creatures to serve as allies in battle. The [Battle of Broken Spears](Battle%20of%20Broken%20Spears.md) is a prime example where summoned beings played a pivotal role in the outcome of the conflict. [Soldiers](Soldiers.md) and [Mercenaries](Mercenaries.md) often tell tales of the fearsome allies that have turned the tide of war, from the ethereal [Whispering Sirens](Whispering%20Sirens.md) to the formidable [Shadow Dragons](Shadow%20Dragons.md).

### Construction and Labor

The practice of Calling is not limited to warfare. It has also been used in more peaceful pursuits, such as construction. The legendary figure Grimbeorn is noted for pioneering the use of Calling to bring forth both materials and laborers from other planes to aid in the building of great structures, some of which can still be seen in the [Free Cities](Free%20Cities.md).

### Exploration and Research

[Explorers](Explorers.md) and [Scholars](Scholars.md) have found Calling to be invaluable in reaching uncharted territories and uncovering ancient secrets. By Calling upon the knowledge of entities like the [Air Elementals](Air Elemental.md), they have mapped out regions such as the [Echovale Isle](Echovale%20Isle.md) and the [Enchanted Grove](Enchanted%20Grove.md). Additionally, the [Keepers of the Eldara Codex](Keepers%20of%20the%20Eldara%20Codex.md) have been known to work alongside conjurers to delve into the mysteries of the arcane.

### Communication

In the realm of espionage and clandestine meetings, Calling has been used to create zones of undetectable conversation. By summoning the sound-absorbing qualities from plants like the [Silent Orchids](Silent%20Orchids.md), spies and diplomats can converse without fear of eavesdropping.

## Elemental Calling

One of the most revered forms of Calling is the summoning of [elementals](Elemental.md). Practitioners use the essence of the elements, such as air, fire, earth, and water, to call forth beings from their respective planes. These elementals serve as powerful allies, sources of knowledge, and, in some cases, the key to controlling natural forces. The [Elemental Essences](Elemental%20Essences.md) article provides further insight into the use of elemental essences in spellcasting and rituals.

## Ethical Considerations

The ethical implications of Calling are a topic of heated debate among the magical community. The act of compelling a sentient being to serve against its will raises questions of morality and the potential for abuse. The [Sanctum of Whispers](Sanctum%20of%20Whispers.md) is known to hold regular councils where the ethical use of Calling is discussed, and guidelines are established to prevent the exploitation of summoned entities.

## Conclusion

Calling remains a cornerstone of the magical arts, a testament to the ingenuity and ambition of those who practice [Conjuration](Conjuration.md). Whether it is used to summon allies in battle, aid in the construction of wonders, or unlock the secrets of the universe, Calling is an art that continues to shape the fabric of reality in the hands of skilled [Wizards](Wizards.md), [Sorcerers](Sorcerers.md), and other arcane practitioners. As the boundaries of knowledge and power expand, so too does the potential of this extraordinary practice.
