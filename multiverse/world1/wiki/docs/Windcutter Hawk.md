# Windcutter Hawk

The [Windcutter Hawk](Windcutter%20Hawk.md) is a majestic and enigmatic bird of prey, renowned throughout the realms for its keen eyesight, extraordinary agility, and the distinctive, razor-sharp feathers that give it its name. These creatures are native to the high cliffs and craggy peaks surrounding the [Verdant Woods](Verdant%20Woods.md), where they build their nests and soar on the thermal currents in search of prey.

## Description

The Windcutter Hawk is easily identified by its impressive wingspan, which can reach up to seven feet from tip to tip, and its sleek, streamlined body. Its feathers are a blend of deep blues and grays, with shimmering silver edges that catch the light as the bird glides through the sky. The most remarkable feature of the Windcutter Hawk, however, is its feathers, which are as sharp as any blade forged by a [master blacksmith](Grimbeorn the Builder.md). These feathers are not only used in defense but also in hunting, allowing the hawk to slice through the air and its prey with equal ease.

## Behavior and Habitat

Windcutter Hawks are solitary creatures, coming together only during the mating season. They are fiercely territorial and have been known to engage in aerial combat with any who dare to intrude upon their domain, including other Windcutter Hawks. Their nests are typically found on inaccessible ledges, where the female lays a clutch of two to three eggs each year.

These birds of prey are most commonly found in the mountainous regions bordering the [Verdant Woods](Verdant%20Woods.md), but they have been spotted as far afield as the [Battlefield of Forgotten Kings](Battlefield%20of%20Forgotten%20Kings.md), where their keen vision aids them in scavenging the remains of fallen warriors.

The feathers are particularly associated with spells of the [evocation](evocation.md) school, where control over elemental forces demands the utmost concentration.

In addition to their magical uses, the feathers of the Windcutter Hawk are prized by [adventurers](adventurers.md) and [warriors](Warriors.md) for their use in fletching arrows, ensuring a strike that is both swift and deadly. The grace of these hawks is also emulated in the spell [Feather Fall](Feather%20Fall.md), where the caster bestows upon themselves or others the ability to descend from great heights with the elegance and control of a Windcutter Hawk.
