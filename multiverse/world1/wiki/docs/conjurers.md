# Conjurers

Conjurers are a specialized class of [spellcraft](spellcraft.md) practitioners who focus on the art of summoning and controlling entities and objects from various planes of existence. Their mastery over the intricate rituals and incantations required for summoning is unparalleled, making them invaluable allies and formidable foes.

## Origins and History

The origins of conjuration trace back to the ancient [Lunar Ancients](Lunar%20Ancients.md), who first discovered the means to bridge the gaps between realms. These pioneering conjurers harnessed the power of the [moon](moon.md) to strengthen their spells, allowing them to call forth beings from the [Ethereal Plane](Ethereal%20Plane.md) and beyond. Over time, the knowledge of conjuration spread, and various schools dedicated to the craft emerged throughout the lands, such as the renowned [Academy of Planar Studies](Academy%20of%20Planar%20Studies.md).

## Practices and Techniques

Conjurers employ a variety of techniques to perform their summonings:

- **Incantations**: As noted in the study of [spellcraft](spellcraft.md), conjurers use specific phrases and words of power to form connections with other planes. These incantations are often complex and require precise pronunciation to be effective.
- **[Gestures](Gestures.md)**: Hand movements and bodily poses are used to shape and direct magical energies during the summoning process.
- **[Reagents](Reagents.md)**: Certain materials are known to resonate with the energies of other planes. Conjurers use these as focal points to aid in the stability and accuracy of their summonings.
- **[Arcane Foci](Arcane%20Foci.md)**: Many conjurers wield specially crafted items that serve as conduits for their power, such as crystal orbs or enchanted staffs.

## Role in Society

Conjurers hold a unique place in society, often serving as intermediaries between the mundane world and the mystical. They are sought after for their abilities to:

- Summon [Elementals](Elementals.md) and creatures for assistance in tasks or combat.
- Acquire rare objects from distant realms for collectors or scholars.
- Provide communication with entities that possess knowledge beyond the reach of ordinary mortals.

## Notable Conjurers

- **[Seraphine the Seer](Seraphine%20the%20Seer.md)**: A legendary figure whose mastery of conjuration was said to be unparalleled. Her legacy is celebrated during the [Moonflower Festival](Moonflower%20Festival.md), where conjurers gather to honor her memory and display their skills.
- **[Pyronus](Pyronus.md)**: A conjurer of infamy, known for summoning fire elementals and binding them to his will. His exploits are a cautionary tale of the dangers of overreaching in the art of conjuration.

## Places of Power

Certain locations are known to enhance the abilities of conjurers due to their inherent magical properties:

- **[Enchanted Grove](Enchanted%20Grove.md)**: Believed to be the final resting place of Seraphine the Seer, this grove is a nexus of natural magic that aids in the summoning of fey and nature spirits.
- **[Caverns of Echo](Caverns%20of%20Echo.md)**: A subterranean network where the veil between worlds is thin, allowing for easier passage of summoned entities.
- **[Frostspire Mountains](Frostspire%20Mountains.md)**: The high altitude and isolation of these peaks create an environment conducive to summoning beings of air and ice.

## Dangers and Misconceptions

Conjuration is not without its risks. The act of summoning can attract unwanted attention from malevolent forces, and losing control of a summoned entity can lead to dire consequences. Additionally, conjurers often face suspicion and fear from those who misunderstand their art, associating them with dark magic and forbidden pacts.

## Conclusion

Conjurers are a vital part of the magical community, with their skills shaping the course of history and the balance of power. Their deep understanding of the connections between all things makes them both respected and feared, as they continue to explore the boundaries of what is possible within the realms of [spellcraft](spellcraft.md).
