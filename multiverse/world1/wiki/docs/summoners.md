# Summoners

Summoners are a distinct class of [arcane practitioners](arcane%20practitioners.md) who have mastered the intricate art of [summoning](summoning.md). These individuals possess the unique ability to call forth entities from various planes of existence, binding them to their will to serve as allies, protectors, or servants. The practice of summoning is a complex blend of [spellcraft](spellcraft.md), [rituals](rituals.md), and deep knowledge of the arcane, making summoners both revered and feared in equal measure.

## Origins and Training

The origins of summoning are shrouded in mystery, with some legends tracing it back to the ancient [Festival of the Falling Leaves](Festival%20of%20the%20Falling%20Leaves.md), where the veil between worlds is said to be at its thinnest. Aspiring summoners often begin their journey by studying under a seasoned mentor, delving into ancient tomes and practicing minor summonings. The [Fallen Temple of the Moon](Fallen%20Temple%20of%20the%20Moon.md) and the [Isles of Whisper](Isles%20of%20Whisper.md) are renowned for housing some of the most extensive libraries and knowledgeable masters in the art of summoning.

## Summoning Techniques

Summoners employ a variety of techniques to call forth beings from other planes, such as the [Ethereal Plane](Ethereal%20Plane.md) or the elemental domains. These techniques can range from elaborate [rituals](rituals.md) involving [arcane foci](arcane%20foci.md) to spontaneous summonings that rely on sheer force of will and power. The most common entities summoned include:

- Elementals, drawn from the raw [elemental energy](elemental%20energy.md) of nature
- Celestial beings, such as those from the radiant realm of [Solara](Solara.md)
- Fiends, from the infernal depths of [Helior](Helior.md)
- Fey creatures, from the enigmatic [Gardens of Nightshade](Gardens%20of%20Nightshade.md)
- Ethereal entities, like the elusive [Shade Wraiths](Shade%20Wraiths.md)

## The Summoner's Pact

A crucial aspect of summoning is the pact made between the summoner and the summoned entity. This pact outlines the terms of service, duration, and the duties the entity is expected to perform. The most powerful summoners can forge pacts with formidable creatures, while novices may only manage to summon lesser beings like [water sprites](water%20sprites.md) or [Windcutter Hawks](Windcutter%20Hawks.md).

## Tools and Artifacts

Summoners often utilize various tools and [artifacts](artifacts.md) to enhance their summoning abilities. These can include:

- Specialized [arcane foci](arcane%20foci.md), such as crystal orbs or enchanted staffs
- [Enchanted](Enchantment.md) circles and sigils, used to contain and control the summoned
- Relics from the [Whispering Sirens artifacts](Whispering%20Sirens%20artifacts.md), known to amplify summoning power

## The Role of Summoners in Society

In society, summoners fulfill a myriad of roles, from advisors to [monarchs](monarchs.md) to defenders of realms. They are often sought after for their abilities to provide supernatural assistance in times of need, such as during the [War of the Shadowed Vale](War%20of%20the%20Shadowed%20Vale.md). However, their power also attracts suspicion and fear, especially when dark summoners delve into [necromancy](necromancy.md) or other forbidden practices.

## Notable Summoners

Throughout history, there have been many summoners whose names have become legend. These include:

- [Theron](Theron.md), the Sage of [Theron's Glade](Theron's%20Glade.md), known for his benevolent summonings
- [Morgana the Shadow](Morgana%20the%20Shadow.md), a summoner who famously turned to dark arts and was a key figure in the [War of the Shadowed Vale](War%20of%20the%20Shadowed%20Vale.md)
- [Eldrin the Wise](Eldrin%20the%20Wise.md), a master summoner who contributed to the [Treaty of the Silverlake](Treaty%20of%20the%20Silverlake.md) by summoning beings of peace and diplomacy

## Challenges and Controversies

Summoning is not without its challenges and controversies. The ethical implications of summoning sentient beings and binding them to one's will are hotly debated among [spellcasters](spellcasters.md). Additionally, the risk of losing control over a summoned entity is a constant threat, leading to potential disaster.

## Conclusion

Summoners are a vital part of the magical community, wielding the power to bridge worlds and call forth allies from beyond. Their abilities shape the politics, warfare, and even the culture of the realms they inhabit. As guardians of an ancient and powerful art, summoners continue to captivate the imagination and respect of all who understand the true extent of their abilities.
