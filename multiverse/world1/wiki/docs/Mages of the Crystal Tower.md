# Mages of the Crystal Tower

The [Mages of the Crystal Tower](Mages%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Tower.md) stand as one of the most enigmatic and powerful orders within the realm of [Aesheron](Aesheron.md). This illustrious assembly of spellcasters has long been intertwined with the arcane history and the pursuit of mystical knowledge. The Crystal Tower itself is a beacon of magical learning and a symbol of the quest for understanding that transcends the ages.

## History

The origins of the Crystal Tower and its mages are as ancient as they are mysterious. It is believed that the tower was constructed during the latter part of the [Age of Twilight](Age%20of%20Twilight.md), serving as a repository for the arcane wisdom of the time. The tower's very walls are said to be imbued with the magical essence of that era, resonating with the power of the [Ancients](Ancients.md) whose secrets it guards.

Over the centuries, the Mages of the Crystal Tower have dedicated themselves to the study and preservation of ancient magic. They have been instrumental in interpreting the prophecies left behind by the Ancients, and their insights have shaped the destinies of kingdoms and empires.

## Structure and Hierarchy

The Crystal Tower is not merely a physical edifice but also a structured society of mages. At its pinnacle sits the Archmage, a figure of immense power and wisdom who oversees the order's activities. Beneath the Archmage, a council of senior mages, known as the Crystal Conclave, deliberates on matters of magical import and the interpretation of ancient texts.

The order is divided into various circles, each specializing in different aspects of magic such as divination, enchantment, or elemental manipulation. Apprentices are taken under the wing of experienced mages, learning the art of spellcraft and the importance of magical responsibility.
