# Healers

Healers are a revered group of individuals within the realm, possessing the sacred ability to mend wounds, cure diseases, and restore vitality to those in need. Their skills are sought after in all corners of the world, from the bustling cities to the most remote villages. The art of healing is not only a profession but a calling that combines knowledge of [Medicine](Medicine.md), [Magic](Magic.md), and often a deep connection to the divine or natural forces.

## Origins and Training

The origins of healing practices are as old as civilization itself, with ancient texts from the [Ruins of Eldara](Ruins%20of%20Eldara.md) depicting figures surrounded by auras of light tending to the injured. The path to becoming a healer is diverse, with some learning through apprenticeship under experienced practitioners, while others study at esteemed institutions like the [Cathedral of Radiant Dawn](Cathedral%20of%20Radiant%20Dawn.md) or the [Great Library of Eldara](Great%20Library%20of%20Eldara.md).

Training to become a healer involves mastering various disciplines, including the use of [herbal remedies](Herbs.md), [incantatory magic](Incantations.md), and the manipulation of elemental energies. A deep understanding of the body and soul is essential, as is the knowledge of [reagents](Reagents.md) that can augment healing spells.

## Types of Healers

### Clerical Healers

Clerical healers draw their power from their devotion to deities such as Solara, whose teachings inspire the nurturing of life. These healers often belong to orders like the [Echoing Conclave](Echoing%20Conclave.md) or the [Gardens of Nightshade](Gardens%20of%20Nightshade.md), where they combine their faith with their healing abilities to perform miracles of restoration.

### Arcane Healers

Arcane healers, also known as [arcane practitioners](Arcane Practitioner.md), utilize the energies of the world, such as the purifying aspects of Water Elemental energy, to mend the physical form. They may employ artifacts, like those sought by the [Lunar Ancients](Lunar%20Ancients.md), to enhance their healing spells.

### Natural Healers

Natural healers, including [druids](Druid.md) and [conservationists](Conservationists.md), harness the regenerative powers of nature. They may seek communion with beings like [Water Sprites](Water%20Sprites.md) to purify and heal, or use the restorative properties of plants and earth to aid their efforts.

## Role in Society

Healers play a vital role in all aspects of society. In times of peace, they maintain the health of communities, often working alongside [Conservationists](Conservationists.md) to ensure the well-being of both people and the land. During times of war, healers are indispensable on the battlefield, saving countless lives and often turning the tide in favor of those they aid.

## Healers in Politics and Warfare

The wisdom of healers extends beyond their medical expertise. The [Council of Elders in Silverlake Valley](Council%20of%20Elders%20in%20Silverlake%20Valley.md) and other governing bodies, such as the [Councils of the Free Cities](Councils%20of%20the%20Free%20Cities.md), often seek the counsel of healers for their insight into the well-being of the populace. In military strategy, healers are crucial for their ability to quickly recover injured soldiers and for their knowledge of artifacts that can protect or restore the fighting force.
