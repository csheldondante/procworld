# Vale of Shadows

The Vale of Shadows is an ethereal and somber region that lies on the outskirts of the [City of Evernight](City%20of%20Evernight.md), serving as a threshold between the world of the living and the realm of spirits. It is a place of profound silence and reflection, where the veil between the material plane and the [Shadowfell](Shadowfell.md) is at its thinnest. The vale is a vast cemetery, an expanse of land where the departed are honored, and spirits are said to roam with a freedom seldom found in any other part of the world.

## Geography

The Vale of Shadows stretches across a landscape of rolling hills and ancient, gnarled trees that seem to absorb the light, casting the entire area in a perpetual twilight. The ground is covered with a fine mist that never fully dissipates, giving the vale an otherworldly appearance. The borders of the vale are ill-defined, merging seamlessly with the [Sea of Lost Souls](Sea%20of%20Lost%20Souls.md) to the east and the darker recesses of the [City of Evernight](City%20of%20Evernight.md) to the west.

## History

The origins of the Vale of Shadows are lost to time, with many believing it to be as ancient as the [City of Evernight](City%20of%20Evernight.md) itself. It is said that the vale was formed from the collective sorrow of the city's inhabitants, a physical manifestation of their grief and loss. Over the centuries, it has become a sacred place, revered by the [Shadar-Kai](Shadar-Kai.md) and other denizens of the Shadowfell for its connection to the afterlife.

## Cultural Significance

The Vale of Shadows holds great spiritual significance for the people of Evernight and the surrounding regions. It is a place of mourning, remembrance, and communion with the past. The [Lady of Sorrows](Lady%20of%20Sorrows.md), a revered figure within the city, is known to walk the paths of the vale, offering solace to the spirits that linger and guidance to those who seek her wisdom.

Families of the deceased often make pilgrimages to the vale, leaving offerings at the graves of their loved ones. It is believed that such gestures please the spirits and can help guide them towards peace or, in some cases, aid in their transition to the afterlife.

## The Spirits of the Vale

The spirits that inhabit the Vale of Shadows are as diverse as the individuals they once were in life. Some are benign presences, echoes of the departed who watch over their resting places or seek closure for their unfinished business. Others are more restless, bound to the vale by regrets or powerful emotions that tether them to the mortal plane.

It is rumored that certain powerful [arcane practitioners](Arcane Practitioner.md) and [seers](Seer.md) have the ability to communicate with these spirits, either to gain knowledge, seek guidance, or employ their aid in [spiritual summoning](Spiritual Summoning.md) rituals.
