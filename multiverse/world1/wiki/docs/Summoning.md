# Summoning

Summoning is an arcane practice that involves calling forth entities, creatures, or energies from other planes of existence or locations within the same plane. This mystical art is a subset of the broader school of [Conjuration](Conjuration.md), and it is utilized by various practitioners such as [Wizards](Wizards.md), [Sorcerers](Sorcerers.md), [Conjurers](Conjurers.md), and even some [Clerics](Clerics.md) who seek the aid of their deities. The act of summoning can serve numerous purposes, ranging from the assistance in battle to the fulfillment of complex [Rituals](Rituals.md).

## History of Summoning

The art of summoning has been practiced since the ancient times of the [Aesheron](Aesheron.md) epoch. The earliest recorded summoning was by the legendary [Morath the Wise](Morath%20the%20Wise.md), who is said to have called forth the Silvermane Horses from the ethereal plains of [Lumina](Lumina.md). Throughout history, summoning has been a tool for both creation and destruction, as seen in the [Mage Wars](Mage%20Wars.md) where summoned creatures fought alongside their conjurers.

## Types of Summoning

Summoning can be categorized into several types, each with its own methods and purposes:

- **[Calling](Calling.md)**: This form of summoning brings creatures to the caster's side to aid in tasks or combat. The creatures called are often sentient and may have their own will, though they are compelled to obey the summoner's commands.
- **[Binding](Binding.md)**: A more complex and dangerous form of summoning, binding involves the conjuration of powerful entities, such as [Efreeti](Efreeti.md) from the [Infernal Planes](Infernal%20Planes.md), and forcing them into servitude. These rituals require precise control and powerful [Reagents](Reagents.md) to ensure the entity does not break free from the caster's influence.
- **[Elemental Summoning](Elemental%20Summoning.md)**: Practitioners may summon [Elemental](Elemental.md) beings or energies, harnessing the raw forces of nature. The [Battle of Broken Spears](Battle%20of%20Broken%20Spears.md) is a notable event where elemental summoning played a crucial role on the battlefield.
- **[Spiritual Summoning](Spiritual%20Summoning.md)**: Some summoners specialize in calling forth spirits or spectral entities, such as the [Whispering Sirens](Whispering%20Sirens.md) or [Shade Wraiths](Shade%20Wraiths.md), often for knowledge or to complete a task that is beyond the physical realm.

## Summoning in Society

Summoning has various applications in society, influencing numerous aspects of life:

- **Military**: Armies have been known to employ summoners to bring forth creatures to serve as allies in battle, providing a significant advantage in [Naval Warfare](Naval%20Warfare.md) and on the [Battlefield of Forgotten Kings](Battlefield%20of%20Forgotten%20Kings.md).
- **Construction**: Figures like [Grimbeorn the Builder](Grimbeorn%20the%20Builder.md) have utilized summoning to call forth materials and laborers from other planes, revolutionizing the way structures are erected.
- **Communication**: By summoning sound-absorbing qualities from plants such as the [Silent Orchids](Silent%20Orchids.md), zones of undetectable conversation can be created, ensuring privacy and secrecy.
- **Exploration**: Adventurers and explorers may use summoning to reach otherwise inaccessible locations, like the [Echovale Isle](Echovale%20Isle.md) or to navigate the treacherous terrain of the [Dwarven Mines](Dwarven%20Mines.md).

## Summoning and the Arcane

Summoning intersects with other arcane practices, often requiring the assistance of [Divination](Divination.md) to locate the entity to be summoned or [Abjuration](Abjuration.md) to protect the summoner during the process. The creation of [Artifacts](Artifacts.md) may also involve summoning, as certain objects are imbued with energies or essences from other planes.

## Ethical Considerations

The ethics of summoning are a topic of heated debate among the [arcane practitioners](Arcane Practitioner.md). Some argue that the binding of sentient beings against their will is a form of enslavement, while others believe that the benefits to society justify the practice. [Conservationists](Conservationists.md) and [Druids](Druids.md) often criticize the summoning of creatures, citing the potential harm to the natural order and the well-being of the summoned entities.

## Education and Research

The [Academy of Planar Studies](Academy%20of%20Planar%20Studies.md) is a renowned institution where scholars and students delve into the intricacies of summoning. Here, they study the theoretical underpinnings of the art and its practical applications. Research conducted by the [Keepers of the Eldara Codex](Keepers%20of%20the%20Eldara%20Codex.md) often involves summoning as they seek to uncover hidden knowledge and artifacts.

## Conclusion

Summoning remains a complex and fascinating aspect of the arcane arts. Whether used for good or ill, the power to call forth beings from beyond the veil holds endless possibilities and continues to shape the destiny of the many realms. As the practice evolves, so too does the understanding of the delicate balance between power, responsibility, and the ethical treatment of those beings who are summoned to serve.
