# Infernal Planes

The [Infernal Planes](Infernal%20Planes.md) are a series of interconnected realms that exist beyond the material world, known for their intense heat, ceaseless combustion, and the ever-present scent of brimstone. These planes are home to a myriad of fiery creatures, including the fearsome [Fire elementals](Fire%20elementals.md), and are a source of fascination and dread among the [scholars](scholars.md) and [sorcerers](sorcerers.md) who study them.

## Geography and Environment

The landscape of the Infernal Planes is as diverse as it is dangerous. It ranges from vast deserts of smoldering ash to towering volcanoes that spew rivers of molten lava. The sky is often obscured by thick, black smoke, and the air is stiflingly hot, making it a harsh environment for all but the most resilient or well-prepared travelers.

### Notable Locations

- **The Searing Expanse**: An endless desert with dunes of cinders and occasional flame geysers.
- **The Obsidian Peaks**: Jagged mountains with lava flows that solidify into glass-like rock.
- **The Charred Forest**: A petrified forest where the trees are forever ablaze, yet never consumed.

## Inhabitants

The Infernal Planes are populated by creatures that embody the essence of fire and destruction. These beings are often hostile to outsiders, seeing them as intruders or potential threats.

### Native Species

- **[Fire elementals](Fire%20elementals.md)**: The most common denizens, they are as unpredictable as the flames they are born from.
- **Salamanders**: Serpentine beings that swim through lava as easily as fish in water.
- **Efreeti**: Powerful and cunning, these genie-like entities command the lesser creatures of fire.

## Magic and the Infernal Planes

Magic within the Infernal Planes is predominantly of the [evocation](evocation.md) school, with spells such as [fireball](fireball.md) and [flame strike](flame%20strike.md) being particularly potent here. The raw elemental energy that suffuses the planes makes them a potent source of power for those who dare to tap into it.

### Arcane Artifacts

Artifacts and [arcane foci](arcane%20foci.md) from the Infernal Planes are highly sought after for their inherent magical properties. [Rods](Rods.md) forged in the heart of a volcano or wands wrapped in the hide of a fire elemental can channel incredible power, making them prized possessions for any [Warlocks](Warlocks.md) or [Wizards](Wizards.md).

## Cultural Significance

The Infernal Planes hold a place of fear and respect in many cultures. They are often associated with destruction, renewal, and the untamable nature of fire. Some cults and religious orders revere the elemental forces at work here, offering sacrifices to appease the fiery spirits or to gain their favor.

### Rituals and Summoning

[Summoners](Summoners.md) and [Conjurers](Conjurers.md) who specialize in [summoning](summoning.md) may call forth beings from the Infernal Planes to serve them. Such rituals are complex and fraught with danger, as the creatures of fire are not easily bound or controlled.

## Travel and Exploration

Venturing into the Infernal Planes is not a task to be taken lightly. The environment alone can slay the unprepared, and the inhabitants are rarely hospitable. However, for those seeking knowledge, power, or rare materials, the risk may be worth the reward.

### Known Expeditions

- **The Ember Seekers**: A group of scholars who braved the Searing Expanse in search of ancient knowledge.
- **The Ashen Brotherhood**: A band of [Warlocks](Warlocks.md) that established a foothold in the Charred Forest to harness its power.

## Conclusion

The [Infernal Planes](Infernal%20Planes.md) remain one of the most mysterious and perilous realms known to the scholars of the multiverse. Their fiery depths are a source of both fear and fascination, promising untold power to those who can withstand their trials. Whether sought out for arcane study, magical power, or sheer adventure, the Infernal Planes will continue to ignite the imaginations and ambitions of many across the realms.
