# Artifacts

Artifacts are extraordinary items imbued with powerful magic, often ancient and steeped in legend. These items are not mere tools but are integral to the history and lore of the realms, holding within them the potential to alter the course of history. They range from weapons of immense power to subtle trinkets that can sway the hearts and minds of those who encounter them.

## Origins and Creation

Artifacts are typically created under extraordinary circumstances. Some are forged during pivotal events such as the [Age of Wonders](Age%20of%20Wonders.md), where magic flowed more freely than it does in current times. Others are the handiwork of legendary [artisans](Artisans.md) or the result of powerful [rituals](Rituals.md) conducted by [mages](Mages.md) and [mystics](Mystics.md).
