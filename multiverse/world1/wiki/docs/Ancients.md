# Ancients

The Ancients, a term that evokes a sense of deep mystery and profound legacy, refers to a prehistoric civilization that once thrived across the vast and varied landscapes of [Aesheron](Aesheron.md).

What little is known has been cobbled together from ancient texts, the oral traditions of the [Nomads of the Eastern Sands](Nomads%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Sands.md), and the mystical insights of the [Mages of the Crystal Tower](Mages%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Tower.md).

The Ancients are believed to have been a diverse and sophisticated society, with a deep connection to the natural and arcane forces of the world. They were master builders, astronomers, and enchanters, whose works suggest a harmonious blend of magic and technology far beyond the understanding of contemporary scholars.
