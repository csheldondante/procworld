# Summoners

Summoners are a unique and enigmatic class of spellcasters within the realm of the arcane, distinguished by their mastery over the art of [summonings](summonings.md). Unlike other practitioners of magic, such as [Wizards](Wizards.md) or [Clerics](Clerics.md), Summoners specialize in the [Conjuration](Conjuration.md) school of magic, focusing their talents on calling forth entities and energies from beyond the veil of the material world.

## Origins and Training

The origins of Summoners trace back to ancient times, where the first practitioners were said to have communed with the spirits of the [Verdant Woods](Verdant%20Woods.md) and the entities residing in the [Crystal Sea](Crystal%20Sea.md). These early Summoners laid the groundwork for the complex rituals and [incantations](incantations.md) that would define the craft for millennia.

Training to become a Summoner is an arduous path that requires not only innate magical ability but also an unwavering dedication to the study of [arcane languages](arcane%20languages.md), [reagents](reagents.md), and the intricate [rituals](rituals.md) necessary to safely and effectively call forth otherworldly beings. Many aspirants begin their journey at the esteemed [Sanctum of Whispers](Sanctum%20of%20Whispers.md), where the accumulated knowledge of past Summoners is preserved and taught.

## The Summoning Process

The act of summoning is a delicate and dangerous endeavor. It involves the precise use of [arcane foci](arcane%20foci.md), the chanting of eldritch [incantations](incantations.md), and often, the offering of specific [reagents](reagents.md) to create a bridge between worlds. The Summoner must have a strong will and clear intent, as even the slightest miscalculation can lead to disastrous consequences, such as the appearance of hostile [Shade Wraiths](Shade%20Wraiths.md) or the unintended breach of the [Well of Stars](Well%20of%20Stars.md).

## Notable Summoners

Throughout history, there have been many notable Summoners whose names have become synonymous with great feats and terrible power. One such figure is [Morath](Morath.md), the Grand Conjurer, who is famed for having summoned the [Silvermane Horses](Silvermane%20Horses.md) from the ethereal plains of [Lumina](Lumina.md). Another is the enigmatic [Seer](Seer.md) known as [Echo Bats](Echo%20Bats.md), who could call upon the voices of the past to whisper secrets and prophecies.

## Summoners in Society

Summoners hold a peculiar place in society. In the [Kingdoms](Kingdoms.md), they are often revered for their abilities to provide aid during times of need, such as summoning [fire elementals](fire%20elementals.md) to combat the spread of wildfires or invoking the gentle [Singing Willows](Singing%20Willows.md) to heal the sick. However, their power also instills fear, leading to suspicion and sometimes persecution, especially when a Summoner's allegiance is unclear.

## The Ethical Debate

The ethics of summoning sentient beings is a topic of heated debate among the magical community. Some argue that the willful binding of another creature to serve one's own purposes is a form of enslavement, while others contend that the summoned beings are mere manifestations of magical energy without true consciousness. This debate often extends to the halls of the [Throne of the Mountain King](Throne%20of%20the%20Mountain%20King.md), where laws regarding summoning practices are hotly contested.

## Future of Summoning

As the world continues to change and the boundaries between realms grow ever more tenuous, the role of Summoners is likely to evolve. Some believe that the future may bring an era where Summoners work in harmony with the beings they summon, forging new alliances and understanding across the planes. Others fear that the increasing power of Summoners could lead to a catastrophic event, such as the legendary [Battlefield of Forgotten Kings](Battlefield%20of%20Forgotten%20Kings.md), where the fabric of reality itself was torn asunder.

In conclusion, Summoners are a vital part of the magical tapestry of the world, wielding the power to shape the course of history with their otherworldly connections. Their craft is one of wonder and danger, requiring a balance of knowledge, wisdom, and caution to master the art of calling forth the denizens of the unknown.
