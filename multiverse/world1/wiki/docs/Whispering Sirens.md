# Whispering Sirens

The origins of the Whispering Sirens are as elusive as their spectral forms. Some scholars of the [The Shrouded City](The%20Shrouded%20City.md) postulate that they are the remnants of ancient [sorcerers](Sorcerers.md) who sought immortality through forbidden [illusions](Illusion.md) and [summonings](Summoning.md). Others believe that they are the collective manifestation of the souls of mariners lost to the treacherous seas surrounding the [Isles of Whisper](Isles%20of%20Whisper.md), bound to the material plane by their unresolved fates.

Whispering Sirens are not corporeal beings but rather exist in a state between the physical and the ethereal. They are capable of influencing the material world through their siren songs, which carry the power to ensnare the minds of the unwary.
