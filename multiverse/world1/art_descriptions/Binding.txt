Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize which images to commission based on their potential impact on the players' immersion and understanding of the game world. The "Applications in Magic" section could be the most valuable, as it directly relates to the players' interaction with the magic system. The "Cultural Significance" section could be next, as it helps flesh out the world and its traditions. The "Risks and Challenges" section, while exciting, might be less critical if budget constraints require cutting back on artwork.
