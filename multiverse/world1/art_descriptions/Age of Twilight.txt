Given the limited budget and the need for harsh value assessment, I would recommend prioritizing the "Architectural Marvels" section for artwork. This section has the potential to visually impress and inspire your players, providing a strong sense of the grandeur of the Ancients' civilization. The other sections, while they could benefit from illustrations, may not have the same immediate impact on the players' immersion in the world.
