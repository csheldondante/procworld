Given the limited budget, it might be best to prioritize the sections that offer the most descriptive value and artistic impact. The "Prelude to War" and "The Conflict" sections seem particularly valuable for setting the scene and mood of the campaign. The "Notable Battles and Sites" could be simplified into one representative image to save costs. The "Aftermath and Legacy" section could be depicted through a single powerful image that encapsulates the new era and its remembrance of the past.
