Given the limited budget, the "Structure" section would likely offer the most value for a visual addition, as it sets the scene for the councils' operations and gives a sense of the environment where critical decisions are made. The "Notable Councils" section could be valuable as well, with a simpler art style that would likely be less expensive to produce. The "Cultural and Historical Significance" section could be the most visually striking and engaging for players, but it might also be the most costly due to its complexity and the need for detailed character representation.
