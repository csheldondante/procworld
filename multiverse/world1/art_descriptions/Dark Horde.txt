Given the limited budget, the artistic and descriptive value should be weighed against the potential difficulties and costs. The "War of the Shadowed Vale" and "The Plains of Valor" sections are prime candidates for artwork due to their high descriptive and artistic value, which can enhance the reader's immersion and understanding of key historical events.
