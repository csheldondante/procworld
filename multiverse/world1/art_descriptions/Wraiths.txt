Given the limited budget, it may be best to prioritize the "Origins" section for artwork, as it provides a strong historical and narrative context which can be visually compelling and set the tone for the wraiths' place in the campaign. The "Characteristics" section could be next in priority, as it helps players visualize what they might be up against. The "Defense Against Wraiths" section could be lower priority unless it is a central theme in the campaign that players will encounter frequently.
