Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize the art that will add the most value to the players' experience. The "Geography" section is a prime candidate for artwork, as it sets the scene for the entire campaign and can be referred back to frequently. The "History" and "Settlements and Structures" sections also offer high descriptive value, providing context and depth to the locations the players will explore. The "Flora and Fauna" section could be lower priority unless specific creatures or plants are central to the campaign's plot or setting.
