Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the sections that offer the most artistic and descriptive value. The "Origins and Beliefs" and "Role in Society" sections seem particularly valuable as they provide insight into the Druids' connection with nature and their societal impact, which are central to understanding their role in the campaign. The "Druid Circles" section could also be visually appealing, but it may be more complex and costly due to the variety of environments and characters.
