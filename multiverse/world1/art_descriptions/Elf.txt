Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the sections with the highest artistic and descriptive value, which in this case would be "Culture and Society" and "Festivals and Celebrations." These visuals would greatly enhance the players' immersion in the world and provide a clearer understanding of elven life and customs. The "Physical Characteristics" section, while valuable, might be less of a priority if budget constraints require a choice to be made.
