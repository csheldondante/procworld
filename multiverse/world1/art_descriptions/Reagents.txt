Given the limited budget, the "Types of Reagents" section is the most valuable for both artistic and descriptive purposes, as it provides a clear visual representation of the items that are central to the article's subject. The "Acquisition and Trade" section could also be valuable, but it may be more complex and costly due to its multipart nature. The "In Culture and Legend" section, while interesting, might be less essential and could be skipped if budget constraints are tight.
