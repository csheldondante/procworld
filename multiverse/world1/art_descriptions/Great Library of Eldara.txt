Given the limited budget, the section on "Architecture" would likely offer the highest artistic and descriptive value, as it sets the scene for the entire library and can inspire awe and curiosity. The "Collections" section would also be valuable, as it provides a glimpse into the treasures the library holds. The "Scholars and Patrons" section could be skipped if necessary, as it may be more challenging to depict the diversity of characters without specific designs.
