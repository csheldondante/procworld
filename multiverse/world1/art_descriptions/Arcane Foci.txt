Given the limited budget, the highest value would likely be in the "Types of Arcane Foci" and "Role in Spellcasting" sections, as they provide a direct visual reference for players to understand the tools their characters might use and the actions they might perform. The "Crafting and Attunement" and "Notable Arcane Foci" sections, while interesting, may be less critical for gameplay and could be considered if the budget allows for additional artwork.
