Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the art pieces that offer the highest descriptive and artistic value. The "Schools of Magic" section seems to be the most valuable in terms of both artistic and descriptive potential, providing a visual representation of the core concepts of magic in your campaign. The "Notable Mages" section is also valuable for giving faces to important historical figures, while the "Challenges and Perils" section could be impactful but might be less necessary if the budget is tight.
