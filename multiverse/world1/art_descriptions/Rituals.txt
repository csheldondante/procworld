Given the limited budget, the focus should be on the sections that would benefit most from visual representation. The "Types of Rituals" section is a prime candidate due to the variety of rituals described, which could be effectively captured in a single, richly detailed collage. The "Ritual Components" section could also be valuable, as it would provide a clear visual reference for the items used in rituals. The "Role of Rituals in Society" could be lower priority unless the communal and cultural aspects of rituals are a central theme in the campaign.
