Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the sections with the highest descriptive and artistic value. The "Magical Significance" and "Lost Temple of the Moon" sections offer the most potential for adding depth and intrigue to the article through visuals. The "Seraphine the Seer" section could also benefit from an illustration, but if budget constraints are tight, this could be considered optional. The "Flora and Fauna" section, while valuable, could potentially be represented through descriptive text if necessary to save on costs.
