Given the limited budget, the value of each piece should be considered in terms of its potential impact on the players' immersion and understanding of the setting. The Acoustic Properties and The Crystal Lake sections would likely benefit the most from visual representation due to their unique and defining characteristics. The Whispering Hall, while also significant, may be less visually unique and could potentially be described in text without losing much impact.
