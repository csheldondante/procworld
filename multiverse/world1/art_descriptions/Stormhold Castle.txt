Given the limited budget, the "Architecture" section is likely the most valuable to illustrate, as it sets the scene for the entire castle and can be used across multiple contexts. The "Cultural Significance" section could also benefit from an illustration to show the vibrancy of the castle's cultural events. The "Current Role" section is less critical to illustrate due to budget constraints, as it focuses more on specific characters whose depictions might be more costly and less reusable.
