Given the limited budget, it may be best to prioritize the artwork that offers the highest descriptive value and artistic impact. The Great Library and The Skyward Temples are likely to be the most visually compelling and informative for the players, while the Inhabitants section could be lower priority unless the Shade Wraiths play a significant role in the campaign.
