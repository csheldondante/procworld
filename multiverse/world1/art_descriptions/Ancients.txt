Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Architectural Marvels" section for artwork, as it encapsulates the grandeur of the Ancients and can serve as a visually stunning introduction to their legacy. The "Ruins of Eldara" could be the next priority, as it provides a direct connection to the Ancients' daily lives and their environment. The "Fallen Temple of the Moon" could be considered if additional budget becomes available, as it offers a more focused look at a specific and iconic structure.
