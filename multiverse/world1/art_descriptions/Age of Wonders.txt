Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the "Overview" section for its potential to capture the essence of the Age of Wonders in a single, impactful image. The "Magic and Technology" section could be considered next for its ability to showcase the unique blend of arcane and craftsmanship. The "Decline and Legacy" section, while valuable, could be depicted through less expensive means such as sketches or even in-game descriptions to convey the sense of history and mystery.
