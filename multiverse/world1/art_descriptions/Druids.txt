Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize the sections that would benefit most from visual representation. The "Origins and Beliefs" and "Sacred Sites" sections are particularly rich in visual potential and could greatly enhance the reader's immersion in the world. The "Relations with Other Orders" and "Threats and Challenges" sections also offer valuable narrative and descriptive visuals but may be considered secondary priorities.
