Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the visual aids that offer the highest descriptive value and artistic impact. The "History and Formation" and "Meetings and Venues" sections are prime candidates for artwork, as they provide significant narrative and atmospheric context to the Council of Defense. The "Structure and Membership" could be considered if additional budget is available, while the "Legacy and Influence" section's map could be a lower-cost, high-value addition.
