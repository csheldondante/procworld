Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize which images will add the most value to your wiki. The "Schools of Magic" section is central to understanding the different types of wizards and would benefit greatly from an illustration. The "Artifacts and Foci" section could use a detailed sketch to help players visualize the tools of their trade. Lastly, the "Challenges and Perils" section could use an exciting image to convey the dangers wizards face, which could be particularly engaging for players. The other sections might not require images as urgently, given the budget constraints.
