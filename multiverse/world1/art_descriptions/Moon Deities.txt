Given the limited budget, it may be best to prioritize the "Pantheon and Worship" section for artwork, as it directly visualizes the deities and their worship, which is central to understanding the article's subject. The "Sacred Sites and Symbols" section could be next in priority, as it provides context and visual anchors for the deities' presence in the world. The "Cultural Impact" section, while interesting, may be less essential for immediate visual representation due to the broader and more abstract nature of its content.
