Given the limited budget, it's important to prioritize which images will have the most impact. The "The Conflict" section is central to the story and would benefit greatly from a vivid depiction of the battle. "Magic and the War" could provide a striking visual of the magical elements, which are crucial to the setting. "Notable Figures" could be more affordable as sketches and would help players visualize the key characters. The other sections might not need art as urgently, considering the budget constraints.
