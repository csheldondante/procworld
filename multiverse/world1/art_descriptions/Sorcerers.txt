Given the limited budget, it would be wise to prioritize the art pieces that would add the most value to the understanding and immersion of the players. The "Origins and Nature" section could benefit greatly from a visual representation, as it sets the foundation for what sorcerers are and where their powers originate. The "Places of Power" section is also a strong candidate, as it can help players visualize important locations that are central to the lore of sorcerers. The "Role in Society" section might be less critical, as it describes the impact of sorcerers rather than their intrinsic qualities or settings.
