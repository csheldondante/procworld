Given the limited budget, I would prioritize the "Tournaments of Arms" section for its potential to excite and engage the players with a depiction of action and competition, which is central to the theme of the festival. The "Silvermane Parade" could also be a strong visual addition due to the unique and magical nature of the Silvermane Horses, which could spark the players' imaginations. The "Harmony of the Singing Willows" might be lower priority unless the mystical and musical elements are a significant aspect of your campaign's storytelling.
