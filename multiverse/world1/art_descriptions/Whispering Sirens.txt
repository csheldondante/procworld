Given the limited budget, I would suggest prioritizing the "Nature" section for its potential to visually capture the essence of the Whispering Sirens and their impact on individuals, which is central to the understanding of these entities. The "Artifacts" section would be valuable as well, as it can showcase the tangible items that players might encounter or seek out. The "Cultural Impact" section, while interesting, could be considered a lower priority unless the "Chant of the Silver Bloom" or similar cultural elements play a significant role in your campaign.
