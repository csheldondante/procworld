We are analyzing a text based adventure and breaking the story down into goals, obstacles and keys.  In this context:

*goal - anything that a character is intrinsically motivated to do.  (e.g. Escaping a dangerous situation, helping an injured friend, obtaining a powerful artifact, breaking a curse etc.)
*obstacle - anything that makes a goal harder to achieve. (e.g. An injured leg that slows down your escape, a protective dog preventing you from reaching your friend, a riddle that must be solved to break the seal and reach the artifact, a corupted spirit that must be defeated in combat to break the curse etc.)
*key - anything that makes an obstacle easier to overcome.  (e.g. An iron pipe you can use as a crutch, knowing the dogs name so you can calmly talk it down, an answer to part of the riddle provided by a mysterious stranger, a magic bow that strikes true against corruption etc.)

Given the following description of the character and scene: 

Character:
{character_description}

Scene:
{scene_description}

Please create a json formatted object containing goals and their associated obstacles and keys.
